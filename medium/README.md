# Medium packages

Folder to store standalone packages which are the examples shown in the related
Medium articles. I am just lazy to create a dedicated repository for each of
them. The Medium packages are not included in the current mono-repository
structure.

Note: some commands relies on the existence of a _package-lock.json_ or a
_yarn.lock_ presence at the root or parent folder. In this case, ensure that
explicit choice of npm or yarn is passed to the command.
