# Standalone packages

Folder to store standalone packages which are not part of the mono-repository.
I am just lazy to create a dedicated repository for them.

Note: some commands relies on the existence of a _package-lock.json_ or a
_yarn.lock_ presence at the root or parent folder. In this case, ensure that
explicit choice of npm or yarn is passed to the command.
